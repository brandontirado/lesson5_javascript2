### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (If and else statments are boolean expresions that are essentially opposite of one another. When using if
    the instuctions you set will run only with the variable associated to it is inputed. Else will do the same but acts
    an extension for specific input associated with the variable.)
2. (Arrays are specific values associated to an element. We did this by associating values to the type of tax filer.)
3. (When running your appication things might not work as originally planned. Using broweser tools to troubleshoot
    your javascript or html code is often more helpful then looking at your IDE. The tool in your browser helps organize
    sections or specific parts of your program.)
